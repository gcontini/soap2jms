---+ Pre-built Client Overview

This section explains how to integrate the client project s2j_client. 
This project is a thin layer over the JAX-WS web service and provides a more friendly interface. 

---++ Requirements

The client is a standard JAX-WS implementation and has no special requirements except Java 6.
It can use Apache CXF as a client library.

If the provided client doesn't meet the requirement of your project, 
for instance it is a .NET environment or it uses Apache Axis with 
a java version lower than 6 consider implementing your own client. See the [[../protocol][protocol]] section.
